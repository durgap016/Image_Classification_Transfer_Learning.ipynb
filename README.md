# Image Classification using Transfer Learning

This project implements an image classification model using **transfer learning** with **TensorFlow/Keras**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a small deep learning image classifier using a pretrained model for accurate image classification.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**
- 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels)
- 10 image classes

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- TensorFlow 2.19.0  
- Keras  
- Google Colab  

---

## ✨ Features
- Transfer Learning with a pretrained CNN  
- Data Augmentation  
- Training & Validation Accuracy/Loss Plots  
- Image Prediction with Confidence Score  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. View training results and predictions
